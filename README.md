# CodeChallenges

Core Java (1.8) is used for coding
added TestNG in pom.xml for assertions
added io.rest-assured library for API testing   

Test data is sent to method using data provoider. (the idea was data driven test that even first set of data is failed, 
execution will continue for next set of data)
Positive and Negative test data is written separately.
